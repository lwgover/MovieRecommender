## Description
This project was designed to generate a graph of movies from a movie review database using custom-coded Graph, WeightedGraph, and PriorityQueue classes. I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to generate movie recommendations based on similarity scores. I created an efficient interface that allowed users to gain insights into the graph, navigating the similarities between movies. As part of this project, I wrote a visual representation of the graph with D3.js, which was designed to give users a clearer understanding of the movie relationships. 

## How to use

The interface is contained within the `src/Analyzer/MovieLensAnalyzer.java` class. Run `javac src/Analyzer/MovieLensAnalyzer.java` then `java src/Analyzer/MovieLensAnalyzer.java` to get movie recommendations!
